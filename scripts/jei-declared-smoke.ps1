# Boots the dedicated server with run/mods, imports a bundle of patches that
# target real modded recipes, then asserts the generated datapack JSON:
#   * the edited slot was rewritten in the mod's own field shape,
#   * every other key of the mod's recipe survived untouched,
#   * the server could parse the result back into a recipe (apply fails otherwise),
#   * the files survive a /reload.
#
# It then probes the pages the editor models without a declaration (create:automatic_packing,
# jerm:jerm_repair and friends): one patch per page, imported on its own, asserting either the
# written JSON or that the server refuses the patch and leaves no file behind. One probe per
# family whose recipes are synthesised outside the recipe manager (Create's draining/spout
# pages, IE's arc recycling, Just Enough Archaeology, Mekanism's alias and smelting pages)
# pins the same refusal for the ids those pages really display - the provenance behind them
# is measured and recorded in docs/JEI_PAGE_COMPAT_TODO.md, "运行时合成页面的真实来源".
#
# With -RestartCycle it stops and starts the server once more and proves on the live recipe
# that the world still loads the generated pack: the probe patch of that cycle carries the
# fingerprint of the already edited recipe, so only a server holding the edited values can
# accept it.
#
# This is the only automated evidence that the declared write path produces JSON
# the mod's own codec accepts. It needs no GUI.
