# scripts/jei-mod-env

The toolchain that assembled the NeoForge 1.21.1 client/server mod pack in
`targets/neoforge-1.21.1/run/mods` — the 76 files the two harnesses
(`scripts/jei-client-tests.ps1`, `scripts/jei-declared-smoke.ps1`) load: 68 active
`*.jar` plus 8 `*.jar.disabled` that were deliberately turned off.

## Requirements

- Python 3, standard library only. No third-party packages, no `pip install`.
- PowerShell 5+ for `run-client.ps1` (Windows).
- Run the scripts from the **repository root**. The batch-1 scripts (`gather.py`,
  `probe.py`, `deps.py`) use cwd-relative literals such as
  `build/tmp/modsearch/hits.json`, so the working directory matters. The rest
  resolve the repository root from their own file location and work from anywhere.

## Pipeline

The order below is the order it was actually run in. Each stage writes JSON state
under the gitignored `build/tmp/modsearch/`.

### Batch 1 — standalone JEI addons

1. `gather.py` — Modrinth keyword search for JEI addons; writes
   `build/tmp/modsearch/hits.json`.
2. `probe.py` — which of those candidates declare JEI at all.
3. `stage.py` — downloads each candidate and reads its **real** metadata out of the
   jar into `staged.json`. Modrinth's dependency metadata is unreliable (it omits
   e.g. Just Enough Resources' JEI dependency), so classification is done from the
   jar, not from the API.
4. `deps.py` — classify the staged jars by their declared dependencies.

### Batch 2 — addons that need content mods

5. `resolve.py` — walks each jar's own declared required mod ids from its own
   `mods.toml`, maps mod id -> Modrinth project, downloads the newest 1.21.1
   NeoForge build, and persists the graph to `tree.json`.
6. `prune.py` — **the authoritative assembler.** Drops every jar whose required
   dependency cannot be satisfied against the pinned environment (`ENV` in the
   script), repeats to a fixed point, keeps only jars reachable from the surviving
   roots, then writes `run/mods` and `prune.json`.

### Runtime verification

7. `verify.py` — recursive, jar-in-jar aware dependency verifier. Also a library:
   `parse_toml` / `scan_jar` are imported by the printer scripts below.
8. `run-client.ps1` — launches the dev client with the installed pack and stops at
   the main menu or on a load failure.
9. `iterate.py` — drives `run-client.ps1`, drops jars that fail only at pre-load,
   and repeats (`removed_by_runtime.json`).

### Visibility-conflict pass (76 -> 68 active)

10. `scan_addon_api.py` — finds addons that call JEI's recipe/ingredient
    visibility API (`hideRecipes` / `unhideRecipes` / `addRecipes` and friends) and
    would fight the editor over the same state.
11. `check_disable_impact.py` — who depends on the jars about to be disabled.
12. `disable_addons.py` — renames the offenders to `*.jar.disabled`. Idempotent;
    renaming rather than deleting keeps the change reversible.

## What is reusable vs. one-off

| Script(s) | Kind |
| --- | --- |
| `gather.py`, `probe.py`, `deps.py`, `stage.py`, `resolve.py`, `prune.py`, `verify.py`, `iterate.py`, `run-client.ps1` | reusable general tooling |
| `scan_addon_api.py`, `check_disable_impact.py`, `disable_addons.py` | reusable, but the target set is the hardcoded 1.21.1 addon list in each script |
| `select2.py`, `final_assemble.py`, `resolve_more.py`, `resolve_more2.py`, `add_layer2.py`, `fetch_datanessence.py`, `pluginscan.py`, `select.py`, `install.py`, `preflight.py`, `assemble.py` | **one-off** historic steps, deliberately left behind in `build/tmp/modsearch/` |
| `search.py`, `probe2.py`, `check.py`, `bwtest.py` | dead scratch files, left behind |

The one-off steps are not optional decoration: they are needed to reproduce batch
2's exact membership (extra manual resolution rounds, a hand-assembled layer, and
the Data Essence/HalcyonJEI removal). They are **not** in the tracked tree — only in
the gitignored `build/tmp/modsearch/`, which is not recoverable from a fresh clone.

## Rebuilding `run/mods` on a fresh clone

`run/` and `build/` are gitignored, so a fresh clone starts with neither the installed
pack nor any of the state under `build/tmp/modsearch/`. Short version: **the exact
current `run/mods` set cannot be rebuilt by scripts on a fresh clone.** This section
says why, and gives the by-hand procedure that does work.

### Why there is no producer for `report.json`

`prune.py` — the authoritative assembler — needs two inputs that no tracked script
produces:

1. `build/tmp/modsearch/report.json`. `prune.py` reads exactly one field of it,
   `report.json["keep"]`, and from each entry only `entry["staged"]` — a path whose
   **basename must match a file in `build/tmp/modsearch/jars/`**, that is
   `build/tmp/modsearch/jars/<slug>__<Modrinth-filename>.jar`. No script here writes
   that file; it was written ad hoc during the original run. Its key data is not in the
   tracked docs: the docs give display versions, not Modrinth file names, and the two
   differ — e.g. doc `1.4.5+neoforge-1.21.1` vs file
   `jeiworldgen-neoforge-1.21.1-1.4.5.jar`, doc `2.0.0` vs file
   `[1.21.1] neoforge-JECT-2.0.0.jar`.
2. `build/tmp/modsearch/jars/` — 221 jars on the machine that built the pack, obtained by
   network search + download (`gather.py`/`stage.py` for batch 1, `resolve.py` for batch
   2). `prune.py` walks this directory to build its `info` map and copies the kept jars
   out of it; with the directory missing it raises `FileNotFoundError`, and with it empty
   it raises `KeyError` while classifying — either way it installs nothing.

Because `prune.py` matches `staged` basenames against that directory, a producer that
guessed names from the docs would silently miss every batch-1 jar. So the gap is not
just "the file is missing"; the data needed to regenerate it faithfully comes from the
network, not from tracked files. No producer has been invented for it.

The exact membership also depended on tracked-and-gone one-off steps — `resolve_more.py`,
`resolve_more2.py`, `final_assemble.py`, `select2.py`, `add_layer2.py`,
`fetch_datanessence.py`, … — and the batch-1 search is not pinned: `gather.py` takes its
keywords as command-line arguments (the original 20 are not recorded anywhere) and every
`pick_version` takes the newest build at run time, which drifts as Modrinth is updated.

### The tracked docs are not a complete manifest either

Downloading exactly what the three docs list does **not** reproduce `run/mods`:

- `just-enough-beacons-reforged` is installed but is missing from
  `JEI_ADDONS_CONTENT_MODS.md`'s "已安装的附属（15）" table.
- `sophisticated-core` and `sophisticated-backpacks` are installed but appear only as
  bare slugs in a prose list in `DISABLED_JEI_ADDONS.md` — no version, no install table.
- The "连带安装的前置模组（23）" table marks `revelationary`, `anvilcraft` and `emi` as
  已剔除: they are rows in the table but must **not** be installed.

### By-hand rebuild (the only faithful path)

1. Download the 76 files listed below from their Modrinth project pages into
   `targets/neoforge-1.21.1/run/mods/`, keeping the exact file names — the docs and the
   tooling refer to them by name.
2. Leave the 8 files under "Disabled" as `*.jar.disabled`; NeoForge only loads `*.jar`.
   If they arrive as `.jar`, `python scripts/jei-mod-env/disable_addons.py` renames all 8
   in one idempotent pass.
3. Check the result: `python scripts/jei-mod-env/verify.py`. Success prints
   `jars: 68   distinct mod ids provided: …` followed by
   `no missing required dependencies`, and exits 0.

The batch-1 network walk still runs — from the repository root: `gather.py <keywords>`,
then `probe.py`, then `stage.py --all-candidates`, then `deps.py` — but it does not
produce `report.json`, so it cannot feed `prune.py`. Treat its output as advisory
research only.

### The 76 target files

Captured from the working-tree `targets/neoforge-1.21.1/run/mods/`. Because `run/` is
gitignored, this list is the only complete record of the set.

## Where the pack is documented

The assembled pack, and why each mod is in it, is described in:

- `docs/JEI_ADDONS_1.21.1_NEOFORGE.md` — batch 1
- `docs/JEI_ADDONS_CONTENT_MODS.md` — batch 2
- `docs/DISABLED_JEI_ADDONS.md` — the 8 disabled jars

Those documents spell out the historic `build\tmp\modsearch\...` paths; the scripts they
describe now live here. As noted above they are not a complete, version-pinned manifest —
the three gaps listed under "The tracked docs are not a complete manifest either" mean the
file list above, not the docs alone, is what a rebuild must follow.

## run-client.ps1 and the JDK

`run-client.ps1` needs the JDK 21 that Gradle uses. It resolves it in this order:

1. `-JdkPath <dir>` if passed,
2. an already-valid `$env:JAVA_HOME`,
3. the default `D:\program\jdk-21`.

If none of those is an existing directory the script throws. Example:

```powershell
pwsh scripts/jei-mod-env/run-client.ps1 -JdkPath 'C:\jdk-21'
```
